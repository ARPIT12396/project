JR Central plans to use the L0 series on the Cho Shinkansen railway line between Tokyo and Osaka, which is under construction.

                The L0 series uses Japanese-designed SCMaglev systems. Nippon Shario, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JR Central, is making fourteen pre-production vehicles.
                
                The seven-car train set a land speed record for rail vehicles of 603 km / h (375 mph) on 21 April 2015. Trains are planned to run at a maximum speed of 500 km / h (310 mph), offering a travel time of 40 minutes between Tokyo (Shinagawa station) and Nagoya and 1 hour of 7 minutes between Tokyo and Osaka.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L0_Series" class="article-read-more">Source</a></p>

                <p class="article-body">TGV (French: Train a Grand Vites, "high-speed train") is France's Intercity high-speed rail service operated by SNCF. The SNCF worked on the high-speed rail network from 1966 to 1974 and presented the project to President Georges Pompidou who approved it. Originally designed as turbotrines powered by gas turbines, the TGV prototype evolved into electric trains with the 1973 oil crisis. In 1976 SNCF ordered 87 high-speed trains from Alstom. After the inaugural service between Paris and Leon on the LGV Süd-est (LGV for "high-speed line") in 1981, the network centered on Paris expanded to connect with major cities in France (including Marseille). Has occurred, Lille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Rennes, and Montpellier) and in neighboring countries on a combination of high speed and traditional lines. The TGV network in France carries about 110 million passengers a year.
                    This allows for a train to engage in emergency braking to request within seconds after all the train to reduce its speed; If a driver does not react within 1.5 km (0.93 mi), the system overrides the control and automatically reduces the train speed. The TVM protection mechanism enables the TGV to use the same line every three minutes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV" class="article-read-more">Source</a></p>

                <p class="article-body">The CRH380A Hexie  is a Chinese electric high-speed train that was developed by CSR Corporation Limited (CSR) and is currently manufactured by CSR Qingdao Sifang Locomotive & Rolling Stock Co., Ltd. As a continuation of the CRH2-380 program it both replaces foreign technology in the CRH2 with Chinese developments and increases its top speed. The CRH380A is designed to operate at a cruise speed of 350 km/h (217 mph) and a maximum speed of 380 km/h (236 mph) in commercial service. The original 8-car train-set recorded a top speed of 416.6 km/h (258.9 mph) during a trial run. The longer 16-car train-set reached 486.1 km/h (302.0 mph).

                    CRH380A is one of four Chinese train series which have been designed for the new standard operating speed of 380 km/h (236 mph) on newly constructed Chinese high-speed main lines. Officially, it is the only series of the four not based on a foreign design, and although it was not produced under a technology transfer agreement, there have been accusations that it is based on unlicensed Shinkansen technology.
                    
                    The other three series are CRH380B, which uses technology from Siemens, CRH380C, with technology from Hitachi, and CRH380D, with technology from Bombardier Transportation.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Railway_CRH380A" class="article-read-more">Source</a></p>

                <p class="article-body">The AGV (acronym for French: Automotrice à grande vitesse) is a standard gauge, high-speed, electric multiple-unit train designed and built by Alstom.

                    Alstom offers the AGV in configurations from seven to fourteen carriages, seating 245 to 446 persons. The trains are constructed from units comprising three cars (each with one transformer and two traction electronics packages located underneath the cars) and single-car driver-trailers. The maximum commercial speed is 360 km/h.
                    
                    Design of the train took place through the early 2000s, with a prototype, "Pégase", produced in 2008. Italian transport company NTV ordered 25 trains in 2008 with services beginning in 2012.
                    
                    According to Alstom, the advantages of the AGV are: increased seating area per train length (compared to a single-deck TGV); safety and maintenance advantages of the Jacobs bogie articulation design as well as higher energy efficiency from permanent-magnet synchronous motors.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGV_(train)" class="article-read-more">Source</a></p>

Besides, it started its journey on the Madrid-Barcelona and Madrid-Valladolid lines in Spain. The train is also known as Pato as its nose resembles the beak of a duck.

                    Spain commenced the trial runs of the entirely constructed prototype in 2002. Additionally, the designers designed the T350 train to be optimally aerodynamic to handle air pressure and air currents at high speeds. Its main feature is the high redundancy level in traction between rail and auxiliary systems. Moreover, it has a lightweight, airtight, and pressurized car body to comfortably pass through tunnels and crossings.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVE_Class_102" class="article-read-more">Source</a></p>
