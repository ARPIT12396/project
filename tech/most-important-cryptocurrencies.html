                <p class="article-body">The first Bitcoin alternative on our list, Ethereum is a decentralized,
                    open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency
                    of the platform. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin.
                    Ethereum is the most actively used blockchain.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum"
                        class="article-read-more">Source </a>

                    <br><br> Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Development was crowdfunded in
                    2014, and the network went live on 30 July 2015, with an initial supply of 72 million coins. The
                    Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can execute scripts and run decentralized applications. Ethereum is
                    used for decentralized finance, the creation, and exchange of NFTs, and has been utilized for many
                    initial coin offerings.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum"

                        class="text-color--1">2.Litecoin</a></h3>
                <p class="article-body">Litecoin (LTC or ≈Å) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software
                    project released under the MIT/X11 license. Litecoin was an early bitcoin spinoff or altcoin,
                    starting in October 2011. In technical details, Litecoin is nearly identical to Bitcoin.<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin" class="article-read-more">Source </a>

                    <br><br> Litecoin is different in some ways from Bitcoin.
                    The Litecoin Network aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, rather than Bitcoin's 10 minutes.
                    This allows Litecoin to confirm transactions much faster than Bitcoin.
                    Litecoin uses scrypt in its proof-of-work algorithm, a sequential memory-hard function requiring
                    asymptotically more memory than an algorithm that is not memory-hard.[citation needed]
                    Due to Litecoin's use of the script algorithm, FPGA and ASIC devices made for mining Litecoin are
                    more complicated to create and more expensive to produce than they are for Bitcoin, which uses
                    SHA-256.

                    When it comes to Litecoin as a method of payment, in the early days there was a correlation to
                    Bitcoin in terms of extended payment patterns. <br><br>Although one might assume that the payment
                    patterns of Litecoin would converge to Bitcoin, it has been found that there is little correlation
                    between the payment patterns of Litecoin vs Bitcoin today, and these patterns continue to diverge
                    over time.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin" class="article-read-more">Source </a>

                        Cardano (ADA)</a></h3>
                <p class="article-body">
                    Cardano is a cryptocurrency network and open source project that aims to run a public blockchain
                    platform for smart contracts. Cardano's internal cryptocurrency is called Ada. The development of
                    the project is overseen and supervised by the Cardano Foundation based in Zug, Switzerland.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The platform began development in 2015 and was launched in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder
                    of Ethereum and BitShares.Hoskinson left Ethereum after a dispute with its co-founder Vitalik
                    Buterin; Hoskinson wanted to accept venture capital and create a for-profit entity while Buterin
                    wanted to keep it running as a nonprofit organization. After leaving he co-founded IOHK, a
                    blockchain engineering company, whose primary business is the development of Cardano, alongside the
                    Cardano Foundation and Emurgo.The platform is named after Gerolamo Cardano and the cryptocurrency
                    after Ada Lovelace.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The currency debuted with a market cap of $600 million. By the end of 2017, it had a market cap of
                    $10 billion and reached a value of $33 billion briefly in 2018 before a general tightening of the
                    crypto market dropped its value back to $10 billion. According to Mashable, Cardano claims that it
                    overcomes existing problems in the crypto market: mainly that Bitcoin is too slow and inflexible,
                    and that Ethereum is not safe or scalable.
